- phones need to be configured for 2G only!
- Tested with 4 phones:
	- Samsung Galaxy S9 (SM-960F): voice and SMS work
	- iPhone SE (software version 14.4.1): doesn't work (doesn't have 2G)
	- Motorola Moto G (XT1068): voice, SMS and GPRS work
	- Samsung Galaxy S III Mini (GT-i8190): voice and SMS work
- useful commands:
	- chans -- to show radio channels
	- tmsis -- to show registered TMSIs/IMSIs
- take phones into flight mode and back out to try reconnecting
- 10 registered SIM cards with phone numbers resembling IMSIs: 510 to 519
- May need to configure sgsntun with IP 192.168.99.100 or so?
